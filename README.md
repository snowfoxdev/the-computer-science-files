# The Computer Science Files

**tl;dr** *This repo scientifically studies and contrasts different parts and paradigms of computing (programming)*

I have become more and more interested in FP (functional programming) and other programming subjects, and I have watched many many talks on them, but I find that the people who give these talks usually do not prove their points from a systematic perspective, but rather try to prove based on what they have experienced. 

Experience should by no means be down-played as unimportantâ€”in fact, experience is one of the most important aspects of being a high-quality software engineer. But some situations need to lean on science rather than experience. For example, Galileo saw four moons going around Jupiter, and if he would like to prove to me that these four moons exist, I would prefer him to write down the systematic steps to see these moons (point your telescope at such and such position and such and such a time, rather than him explaining how much experience he has had looking at these moons.

I believe the computer science and software engineering communities need help. Hopefully this repo will help. I intend to eventually publish this material on a nice looking website rather than just having it  on github. In this repo, I intend to study and contracts different parts and paradigms of computing (programming), and scientifically show the costs and benefits of each.
